                    <p>
                      When I first passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate
                      exam, I immediately started looking for projects to
                      utilize my skills and gain more hands-on experience. I
                      first saw this project being greatly discussed in the
                      online cloud community and thought I would take up the
                      challenge. This is my attempt at the AWS Cloud Resume
                      Challenge created and published by Forrest Brazeal. (This
                      website is the project, by the way!)
                    </p>

                    <h2>Frontend</h2>

                    <p>
                      This project has numerous components. The user interface
                      was simple. It was created using HTML, CSS, and
                      Javascript. My website is not flashy (obviously), but I
                      don't believe it is essential for a cloud project. My
                      frontend files were hosted on S3. I bought a domain from
                      Route 53 and set up a distribution on Cloudfront to take
                      advantage of the edge locations where my website's content
                      is delivered. I then utilized ACM (AWS Certificate
                      Manager) to request a certificate for my domain so that my
                      website could be secured using HTTPS.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      While doing all of this, I ran into a handful of little
                      difficulties. For example, I ran into a problem with Route
                      53's NS records. When I started this project, I decided to
                      use AWS IAM Identity Center (previously AWS Single
                      Sign-On) and set up a separate AWS account solely for this
                      project's development. However, I had purchased the domain
                      using a different AWS account previously, so I migrated
                      the domain between accounts and created a new hosted zone.
                      It took me a bit of time to realize I needed to update the
                      domain registration with the existing NS records. After
                      that, I was able to set up Route 53 to point my domain
                      name to the CloudFront distribution. I then forgot about
                      Cloudfront caching as I was trying to update the files.
                      Well, I was not going to wait 24 hrs for my website to be
                      updated. I thought of invalidating the files on
                      Cloudfront. However, in order to make new files available
                      instantly in a more cost-effective approach, I chose to
                      update existing files using custom-versioned file names.
                      Overall, these steps were very straightforward in
                      comparison to what came next. But at this time, I recall
                      thinking, "I must be halfway there!" Ha. I was naive.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Backend</h2>

                    <p>
                      I started working on the backend of the project, and
                      considering the project's requirements for a NoSQL
                      database, DynamoDB is a suitable choice. For the visitor
                      counter, I created a table with a single number field. I
                      then went to Lambda and wrote a function in Python. Since
                      I had limited familiarity with Python, I had to do a bit
                      of research before I could write the code. The goal was to
                      have the function save a value to the DynamoDB table
                      everytime it is called. I also had to figure out the IAM
                      permissions between the function and the table. What was
                      frustrating and unclear to me at first was the CORS error
                      I was receiving. After a significant amount of googling, I
                      learned the proper headers to the Lambda function's
                      response are required. I did some tests in the AWS console
                      and was relieved to see that my counter was finally
                      working.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I then moved onto the API Gateway and created a route in
                      front of my Lambda function to prevent direct connection
                      between my Javascript code on the webpage and my DynamoDB
                      table. I used the POST HTTP method because it is commonly
                      used to update API resources (my visitor counter has to be
                      incremented every time this function is called). I also
                      added a Route 53 record to the API Gateway and generated
                      an API mapping that points to the API. Although this was
                      optional, I now have a secure API endpoint. The final step
                      in this section was to write some Javascript code that
                      called an API to update my DynamoDB table and display the
                      revised count.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Infrastructure as Code</h2>

                    <p>
                      In this section, I chose to challenge myself by learning
                      Terraform, which may be the most used DevOps tool these
                      days. It was confusing at first having to convert all of
                      my existing AWS resources into Terraform code. This is
                      when I discovered how powerful Terraform could be.
                      Infrastructure as Code defines and deploys the
                      infrastructure settings you need, which means I can
                      instantly recreate my resume if I destroy it or move it to
                      another cloud provider. I can see how this can
                      significantly streamline processes, save valuable time and
                      reduce errors. I think I am ready for the DevOps life, ha!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      My experience with the Cloud Resume challenge was
                      rewarding. The project itself was definitely unique and
                      challenging. The components and services covered provided
                      me a comprehensive overview of job-related skills and
                      knowledge required. It took approximately a month for me
                      to complete most of the essentials. I intend to go back
                      and refactor some of the code soon in addition to adding
                      some tests and features. But for now, this is where I will
                      pause and reflect.
